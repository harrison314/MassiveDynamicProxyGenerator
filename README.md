# MassiveDynamicProxyGenerator
_.Net library for generate proxy class instances_

_Massive Dynamic Proxy Generator_ is  a library for generating lightweight
.NET proxies on the fly at runtime. Proxy objects allow calls to members
of an object to be intercepted without modifying the code of the class.
Both classes and interfaces can be proxied, however only virtual members
can be intercepted.

Fertures:
* Dynamic proxy genrator, for intercept `dynamic` objects.
* Proxy instance generator, for intercept.
* Proxy instance generator, for control instancing real implementation (e.g. lazy loading).
* Decorator generator.

The following platforms are supported:
* .Net 4.0 and up.
